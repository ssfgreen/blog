Over the last couple of days I've been writing a funding proposal for educating kids to code in Python.

My company ![Turinglab](www.turinglab.com) teaches kids to code in Python. We've been doing this for over 7 years and have taught over 100,000 kids to code.

We've used Python in the past to do data analysis, however we switched a few eyars ago to writing our own data extraction and analysis code in Node.js.

This is primarily because we run a full JavaScript stack, with a Node.js, MongoDB backend and React, Redux frontend.

For one project it made sense to adapt some database migration scripts to also also do some basic data analysis. We continued doing this for a few more projects, but it was always a bit of a hack.

This week I sat down and rewrote the core data-analysis tasks we need to do in Python. I used Pandas to do the data analysis and Matplotlib to do the visualisation.

The core output of this task was:

- Number of students: this is the number of students who have completed at least one task in the platform during the required period
- Number of active schools: these are the number schools with active students
- Number of active teachers: these are the number of teachers with active students
- Number of challenges completed
- Number of hours students spend learning on Turinglab: which requires parsing our a tracker object (with start and end times) for work completed by each student
  - A breakdown of the number of hours spent on Turinglab (by student) in a histogram
