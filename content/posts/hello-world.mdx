This is the first post of my new blog.

The aim is to write up what I'm learning while I build. I'm hoping that this will help me to learn more deeply and to share what I'm learning with others.

# This Blog

This website / blog is made using a few technologies that I like - some I've used before and some are new to me.

## The big ones

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework for building static and server-rendered applications
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - A fileformat that allows you to write JSX in your markdown content - ideal for creating interactive blog posts
- [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) - A content SDK that validates and transforms content into type-safe JSON data
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - A platform for hosting static websites and serverless functions
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript

## Some additional libraries

- [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) - A set of free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons for UI development
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) - A tiny (228B) utility for constructing `className` strings conditionally
- [rough-notation](https://roughnotation.com/) - A library for creating and animating annotations on a web page
- [rehype-autolink-headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings) - A rehype plugin to automatically add links to headings
- [rehype-pretty-code](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/) - A rehype plugin to prettify code blocks

# MDX Demonstration

Just a quick demo of MDX.

## Aside

I've included an 'Aside' in my markdown file:

```mdx
<Aside styled>
  This is an aside - hopefully it will allow me to draw attention to points that
  I don't want to include in the body text.
</Aside>
```

## Link Previews

This is a little JSX component that calls an API I created to fetch a website and
return the open-graph data to allow me to render links to other webpages I have created nicely.

For example, I wrote this Jypyter notebook on Kaggle to explain how to use Binary splits to create a baseline model for the (yes, well used) Titanic dataset:

```mdx
<LinkPreview url="https://www.kaggle.com/code/greensamiam/titanic-dataset-a-single-binary-split" />
```

With the resulting output being as follows:

<LinkPreview url="https://www.kaggle.com/code/greensamiam/titanic-dataset-a-single-binary-split" />

## Code blocks

I can create codeblocks and highlight imporant parts for you.

For example, below is a codeblock that shows some code for the LinkPreview component:

- **Lines 2-3** - calls an API to fetch the data for the link preview
- **Lines 14-16** - ensures that the component is only rendered when the data has been fetched
- **Line 18** - renders the preview card

```js showLineNumbers title="LinkPreview.tsx" {2-3,14-16,18}
async function getPreivewData(url: string) {
  const res = await fetch(API + `?url=${url}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  return data;
}

export const LinkPreview = ({ url }: { url: string }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState<PreviewData | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    getPreivewData(url).then((data) => setData(data));
  }, [url]);

  if (!data) {
    return null;
  }

  return <PreviewCard data={data}>;
};
```

# Conclusion

This is just a quick post to kick-start the year, but I hope it allows you to explore the technologies I've used to build this blog should you want to create a similar one.
