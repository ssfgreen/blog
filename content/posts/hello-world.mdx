This is an initall Hello World Blog post with some features I'm exploring for my blog

### Headings

At the base level, each blog will have a series of headings that are easy to access

### Something Creative

Something creative will follow

  Note: This post is not finished. I sometimes publish early in case it will be
  helpful to someone.

```js showLineNumbers title="contentlayer.config.js" {4-5,9}
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from "contentlayer/source-files";

export const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
  name: "Post",
  contentType: "mdx",
}));

export default makeSource({
  documentTypes: [Post],
});
```

### Preview Component

This is a component in MDX being rendered simply as

```mdx
<LinkPreview url="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic" />
```

With the resulting output being as follows:

<LinkPreview url="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic" />
